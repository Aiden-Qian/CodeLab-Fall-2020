## Week 1

1. [Sum of two Strings](https://github.com/HappyCoder29/CodeLab-Fall-2020/blob/master/SumTwoStrings/src/edu/northeastern/ashish/Main.java) : Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.
2. [Two Sum Problem](https://github.com/HappyCoder29/CodeLab-Fall-2020/blob/master/TwoSum/src/edu/northeastern/ashish/Main.java) : Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
3. [Rotate and array](https://github.com/HappyCoder29/CodeLab-Fall-2020/blob/master/RotateArray/src/edu/northeastern/ashish/Main.java) : Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
4. [Is Unique](https://github.com/HappyCoder29/CodeLab-Fall-2020/blob/master/AllUnique/src/edu/northeastern/ashish/Main.java) : Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
5. [Check Permutation](https://github.com/HappyCoder29/CodeLab-Fall-2020/blob/master/IsPermutation/src/edu/northeastern/ashish/Main.java) : Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other
