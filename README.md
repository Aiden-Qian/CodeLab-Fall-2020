## Week 1

1. Sum of two Strings: Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.
2. Two Sum Problem: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
3. Rotate and array: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
4. Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
5. Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other
